/*
Desc:	Sorta a hack/workaround to get interfaceish things into this engine.
		To use an interface just override the proc in your object and set it to return true.
		If an object returns true for one of these it should have ALL of the commented out procs and vars defined in its class.
		There may be some example code in procs below the defines to help explain things, but you don't have to use it.
