blarg missiles

75. for areas that are important but not off the grid, put a device that behaves exactly like an SMES with much less storage capabilities near the room(s) that need a backup supply that draw from the grid and output only to those rooms
[9:53:27 PM] L Z: an SMES can do this job already but it's too fucking big to work practically
[9:53:53 PM] L Z: so make a smaller one with lower input/output/storage maximums and call it an UPS
[9:54:19 PM] L Z: these exist in real life by the way and do this very thing
[9:56:53 PM] L Z: But keep in mind that the UPS should behave like a SMES but on a smaller scale
[9:57:58 PM] L Z: and it should default to working properly instead of needing someone to set the charging and I/O values and should in fact be locked to anyone without proper permissions

77. ADD ABLILITY TO COMBINE A BUTT AND A SECURITY HELMET
[10:23:30 PM] L Z: BUTT HELMETS

78. Fix laying down and getting back up.

79. Add butts.

80. Add poop. And pooping.

81. Throwing poop = splatter, destroying poop. Dropping poop = splatter, destroying it.

82. New AI module: Mecha control.

83. Every AI module takes up space. AI selected modules on creation. More can be researched/created and added to the AI later on, if space is left.

84. Brain transplants between humans and other life forms.

85. In the poop material creation code, change the 10 to a value stored in poop that specifies how much material it is composed of. UPDATE: Just take all the poop material and create poop with it, and set its material ammount to the ammount of poop material there was when it was created.

86. As the poop splatters over stuff, it loses bits and pieces of itself, gradually getting smaller. So, let's say throwing it removes 5 material. The poop started at 10. It now is half size, having 5 material. One effect is the sprite got smaller.

87. If thrown poop hits eyes, it blinds somebody until they wash their face.

88. On traitor and all applicable game modes, default respawning to disabled.

89. Bug report: If a person has had one or more characters die (and they respawned, of course) and they're currently alive, and the brain from one of their old corpses is cut out, that brain will steal the client away to it leaving the guy they were just playing clientless.

90. Make terralabs accessible only to client addictgamer.

91. The AI access bridge. Basically, it's an area that warps in from another dimension when the AI calls it, making it easy for people to access the AI say. Perhaps instead of this, a special teleporter that teleports directly into the AI sat that only works when the AI enables it.

92. Grab an updated (and working) version of the atmos code from either tgstation or bs12.

93. Late spawn as AI.

94. Make poop go into hand when pooping. If hand doesn't have room, drop it on floor.

95. Alien queen can take human corpses, inject them with plasma, and place them a little lifeform in them that can work on a "trigger bomb on impact, timer, remote control, or somebody passing next to this of the specified species."

96. Game setup lobby. Default the game starts as it does now. However, an admin can interrupt that and open up a game lobby where they can assign players jobs, add NPCs, set up events, etc. Ya, setup the game.

97. Realistic health system. And limbs. And organs. And stuff like that. This also brings a combat rewrite. 

98. Add a command that makes a mob a NPC.

99. The piratize function makes clientless mobs NPCs. Make it check to make sure that mob is unable to get a client again.

101. Make the "walk_around" task walk only where the NPC can.

103. Allow cloning of NPCs and the like. This probably requires giving NPCs a client, with a "npc" variable set. Ya, that's it. even better than the current system.

104. icons/obj/pipes/disposal.dmi : Add north and south icons for the toilet.

105. Syringe guns and DNA injectors.

106. Nuclear gun doesn't just have nuclear reactor. It fires nuclear explosives.

107.  if (singularity.size == 3) play_nyan_on_repeat()

108. Make the hivebot invasion music play the entire time hivebots spawned from the invasion exist.
